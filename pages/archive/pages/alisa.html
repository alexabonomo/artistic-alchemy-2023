        <h2>OVER BLACK.</h2>
        <p>MUSIC CUE: “Aï-Aï Heyveh Heyveh,” plays through an old radio.</p>

        <h2>1. EXT. ARMENIAN VILLAGE - MIDDAY - ANIMATION</h2>
        <p>In the late afternoon, in a quiet village, a young boy shoots a cherry pit that lands squarely between the eyes of MIKA DROMA (22, long curly hair and tan skin).</p>
        <h2>END MUSIC CUE.</h2>
        <h2>2. INT. MIKA’S BEDROOM - DAWN - LIVE ACTION</h2>
        <p>A cicada hits the window. Mika opens her eyes. She finds herself in her sunlit childhood bedroom, upstate, near the Hudson. </p>
        <p>She sits up. She picks up a half-drank cup of tea from her bedside table and pulls on the pussy riots t-shirt her mother hated. A pause before...</p>
        <h2>3. INT. LIVING ROOM - DAWN - CONTINUOUS</h2>
        <p>...she walks out of her room into a dark hallway towards a bright living room. Threadbare rugs overlap on the ground. </p>
        <h2>4. INT. KITCHEN - DAWN - CONTINUOUS</h2>
        <p>She puts on cheap SONY headphones.</p>
        <p>MUSIC CUE: (loud)”Human Behaviour”, Björk</p>
        <p>We see the back of Mika in green underwear, she leans into the kitchen window. She turns to put the kettle on and shimmies onto the countertop across from the stove. She bites into a juicy fig. Her face changes. She takes her headphones off, music still playing.</p>
