        <p>Cyanotype by Rob Sommerlad</p>
        <img width="100%" src="../../../images/rob_cyanotype.png">
        <p>This image is a cyanotype print produced with olive oil, bleach and salt during an Artistâ€™s Date. However, it is also: an example of synchronicity, an abandoned idea composted into something new, a pun, a U-turn come full circle, a step outside my comfort zone, a rejection of the scarcity mindset, an act of play, and a treasured souvenir from a strange, challenging, but very valuable experience.</p>
