        <p><em>About a year ago in a meditation, I had been deep in a lucid state for some time when an old man and an old woman entered from the sides. Their profiles read like characters of a Grimms fairy tale—wise but undoubtedly complex and mischievous. They were each holding the open end of a live wire, hands moving in parallel toward each other. Upon contact, the wires sparked with an explosion of light, illuminating their faces like lightning might during a storm. At that moment, my lucid state ended abruptly as I got the feeling of being shot “up” and back into the present moment. </em></p>
        <p><em>I only experienced this scene as about 3 seconds long, and the meaning that I made from it has changed a few times, but as the illustration is “finished” it is resonating as a reminder that we light up when the different parts of ourselves “connect”, even (or especially) the ones in the shadows.</em></p>
        <p><em>The faces are inspired by the work of Arthur Rackham.</em></p>

        <p>I started this piece before Artists Way, and I finished it after, but 20 minutes here and a few lines there were completed as we completed the course. At a certain point, I considered depicting the man and woman in a more graphic but familiar style that left them feeling younger than what I saw in my vision - but I was motivated by my peers to push myself and find a way to show them as aged, wise, and mischievous like I saw them. Additionally, I like to think that the questions in the book, the community, and the consistent exercises are what helped me process this experience and the creative expression of it so that when it was time to finish it, I was ready.</p>
        <p>This piece depicts the moment of the alchemy as the connection of the wires, which is both the ending and the beginning. In my meditation experience, the wires touching was the anticipated narrative, and yet as soon as that moment was realized with the spark—the experience was over. The subsequent explosion exposes an “eye of the creator” in the background. The resulting transformation is unknown, but the nature of the scene ending makes apparent that alchemy has occurred.</p>
