        <p>My choreographic work explores the darker parts of the human psyche. Movement has always interested me as a form of expression that can articulate feelings and emotions that words don’t do justice. While I was formally trained in many forms of dance growing up, I am most drawn to guttural movements that feel instinctive as well as popular and commercial dance styles.</p>

        <p>My first piece of choreography was inspired by my home state, Wisconsin, and the fact that so many serial killers are from there. I was interested in our obsession with serial killers in the media and wanted to play on this obsession and infamy by making two known serial killers the stars of the dance, Ed Gein and Jeffrey Dahmer. This piece imagines if Ed & Jeff had become best friends and were gleefully but maniacally discussing their crimes while showing off for the audience.</p>

        <p>Mental illness and neurospiciness runs in my family, from depression and anxiety to OCD and ADD. From an early age I was told to alert my family if I had sad or worried thoughts, and years of therapy and medication have helped me immensely. Pharmaceuticals explores how I imagined my meds working inside my brain, sparkling, jumping, getting to work, then slowing down at their halflife. I also wanted to showcase the feeling of anxiety through movement with ticking, sporadic changes, and rumination. Dancers improvised personal ticks to bring their own energy and experiences to the work. Mental illness is so common yet has such a stigma still, so I wanted to create something weird and beautiful out of the subject.</p>

        <p>I studied Monster Ideology in school and learned how when we make monsters out of people who are different from us in some way – race, gender, sexuality, nationality, religion, economic status, etc. – we become the monster ourselves. This has been proven throughout history and even in the monster stories that we tell. Fear of “other” and trying to remove the “other” from one’s society makes humans even more of a monster than what we fear. The masks represent homogeny and societal expectations, production, capitalism, and ultimately violence, while the colorful makeup underneath represents unique individuality that’s also expressed in improvised personal movements to show how beautiful every person is because of their differences, not in spite of them. I created this in hopes that we could learn from our shared history and stories to avoid repeating history, unfortunately this piece feels especially relevant today.</p>
