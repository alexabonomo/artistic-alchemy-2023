        <p>Blue Guitar by Kristen Heritage</p>
        <p>Maybe all of this is beside the point, but I want to tell it to you. Maybe I want to tell it to myself. Maybe
            I am just being indulgent, but I want to construct a myth around my blue guitar, barely visible though it is
            throughout most of the video.</p>
        <p>On one of my first artist dates, I ended up at The Big Reuse looking for a blender I could make paper mache
            in. No dice. All the small appliances there were in parts and pieces, strange debris flaking off of their
            amputated parts. Frustrated, blood sugar perilously low, I took a look at the books on offer, since there
            were oh so many.</p>
        <p>After some perusing, a certain title caught my eye, but I didn’t believe it at first. Too much of a
            coincidence. A couple nights prior, I’d read an article that quoted Bluets by Maggie Nelson, demonstrating
            how she’d “abandons even the comfort and sense-making of the paragraph form”--</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>The most I want to do is show you the end of my index finger. Its muteness.</em></li>
            <li><em>That is to say: I don’t care if it’s colourless.</em></li>
            <li><em>And please don’t talk to me about ‘things as they are’ being changed upon any ‘blue guitar’. What can bechanged upon a blue guitar is not of interest here.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>And I was holding a copy of Bluets, in pretty good condition</p>
        <p>I have a blue guitar.  A Squier Paranormal Cabronita Telecaster Thinline - Lake Placid Blue with Parchment Pickguard. I got it because it was cheap and lightweight, easy to haul around.  It had gathered dust in New Jersey, in my dad’s spare room for a few months.  I’d brought it there to practice.  When my hands got bad, I spent lots of time at my dad’s house, but I’d stopped practicing.  I’d stopped listening to music, too.  It hurt too much.</p>
        <p>I bought the book, and a couple others.  I liked that it was small and decided to start it on the train home.</p>
        <p>The next day, I showed up at 8 am to my jobsite at the Javits Center and called my boss.  In a film, this is where we’d cut away to watch a small comedy of errors unfold elsewhere.  It turned out that not only had I been erroneously called in an hour early, my boss wouldn’t arrive until at least an hour after that.  All this in a series of confused calls and texts between my boss and the shop manager.</p>
        <p>I am not the only one confused on the steps of the Javits Center.  It is one of the designated install days for New York City Comic Con, and first time vendors are lugging cases of their wares in the wrong direction while tourists and fans rubberneck through the Javits’ glass walls.  I have no business there until my boss makes it through New Jersey.I slip away to a manicured little scrap of park (Hudson Park) and read the book for a couple hours.  A couple liminal blue hours on an undulating park bench.</p>
        <p>That night in Artists’s Way class, I mention picking up Bluets.  Ella says it’s one of her favorites.  She’d read it multiple times, and given copies of it to crushes.  A couple other people in class had read or heard of it.</p>
        <p>The myth of the book grows in my mind.  It morphs into a cloud of cerebral vapor around the image of my blue guitar, of the sacred, the unknown, the unknowable.  My boyfriend and I had talked once about the fact that people know scientifically why the sky is blue (rayleigh scattering) and it’s one of those cases where science’s answers are just horribly unsatisfying.  (Chang Tzu said, to let understanding stop at what cannot be understood is a high attainment. Those who cannot do it will be destroyed on the lathe of heaven.)</p>
        <p>The next weekend, I am uptown at a meet up for an artist community I’m part of, muffling my social anxiety with boxed wine.  I catch a glimpse of a woman I don’t recognize wearing a blue beanie with a logo I do recognize.  It’s a distinctive logo: a large-eyed, elfin face surrounded by tangled curls, or vines.  It’s the logo of Electro Harmonix, a guitar pedal manufacturer.  I ask her about it, and she says she got it at a pedal expo earlier that day.  We talk about gear and guitars, and she introduces me to her partner and her dog.  The three of them are Sophia, Steven, and Sunbear.  They do sound, light and installation art, and it happens that they were working with a curator I knew to put together one night art and performance events.</p>
        <p>When they reached out a couple days later to ask if I’d like to perform at their next event, my initial instinct was to say no.  At the same time, I was flattered by their faith in me, since they’d never seen or heard me perform before.  I’d barely performed original material before.  The title of the event was, At the Edge of the Infinite.  My blue guitar, on its zephyr of infinite blue, drifted into my mind.  I thought, I can make something.  I can sit in my bedroom with the blue guitar and my pedals and my little amp and I can draw something up from the infinite well behind fear.  A Julia Cameron quote about walking through doors floats into my head unbidden.</p>
        <p>I think she’d say something like, when you ask The Great Creator to be a musician, don’t be surprised when the universe gives you a chance to try your hand at ambient music!</p>
        <p>And I did, and I was changed upon my blue guitar.</p>
