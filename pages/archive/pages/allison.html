        <p>What shitty paintings and the Artist’s Way taught me. </p>
        <h1>Morning pages 10/13/23 </h1>
        <p>I skipped my morning pages but here I am. For probably 5 minutes. Ah.</p>
        <p>I’ve been pretty quiet at the industry days in Chicago. But I think it’s ok. I’m trying to feel more like myself. Do my thing. What’s right for me. That’s the best way to channel me and my creative spirit.</p>
        <p>So today I might not make any lasting relationships. I’m not sure!</p>
        <p>A pitch for film—</p>
        <p>To make a movie that only you could make. That the film is you. And shows you in some way.</p>

        <p>Under the new camera equipment, connections, business development, distribution strategies, and fundraising is just me… sometimes with a camera. And like I do with my morning pages, I want to give myself some slack, let go, and allow myself to make mistakes again. </p>
        <p>I used to do this before when I was a painter, but I somehow forgot. To make something unfathomable to me, a gift from the universe, with the remnants of something really, really shitty. 
        </p>
        <p>I made this painting one afternoon over a shitty painting. The colors in the original painting made me feel unsettled and just icky. I would attach the reference photo, but I lost it because it was just ew, made me feel a little pukey. I let it dry, sit there for a while, and moved on to other pieces. 
        </p>
        <p>But then, I had the most insane weekend and I was ready to paint. I had a vision, grabbed some reference photos, and a plan to paint over that shitty painting and make something better. 
        </p>
        <p>My painting approach is spontaneous and athletic. The marks were coming naturally and flowing. I felt full of force and power and I was in sync with the paint. ;) 
        </p>
        <p>I was ready for my last move of the painting, I realized it was getting good and I had one last move to finish it… I took out my painting knife and I scraped on yellow paint with confidence. Only to my horror, I looked at my mark and saw BLUE! I looked down at the knife, did I dip my knife in the wrong color? What just happened?!
        </p>
        <p>I looked back…I had scraped through my new painting to reveal blue from the shitty painting underneath. I cocked my head to the right and looked at it again…
        </p>
        <p>I took a deep sigh—it was perfect.</p>
        <p>I would have never made that choice consciously. I felt grateful and light. Grateful for that shitty painting and tapping into a deeper understanding of art and the universe and the way things connect and collaborate in ways you’d never expect. </p>
        <p>Sometimes we’re going to make shitty paintings. And films. And drawings. And decisions.But the Artist’s Way has helped me tap into my sensibility.</p>
        <p>Letting go isn’t giving up—it’s giving me space so I can grow and float and think. I’m remembering how to open up. </p>
